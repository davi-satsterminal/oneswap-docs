## Availability snapshot

| Token | DevNet availability | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CC (Amulet) | Public faucet | Recommended for testing |
| USDCx | Limited | No public faucet |
| CBTC, frxUSD, EURe/GBPe/USDe | Usually MainNet only | Check latest issuer guidance |

## Tap CC through backend

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tap/cc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"party":"<party-id>","amount":"100.0"}'

curl http://localhost:3001/api/tap/balance/<party-id>
```

## USDCx note

USDCx typically requires issuer support or dedicated test allocations. For AMM pipeline tests, teams often use controlled mock tokens in isolated environments.
