title: Getting started
description: Run OneSwap locally and connect to a Canton validator.
---

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js `18+`
- Access to a Canton participant JSON API
- Optional: Daml SDK for rebuilding DARs

## Local development quick start

```bash
# from the AMM app root
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

This helper script builds DARs, uploads contracts to a local participant, and starts:

- Backend on `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`

## Manual startup

```bash
# build contracts
./scripts/build-dars.sh

# backend
cd backend
npm install
export CANTON_API_URL=http://localhost:6501
export CANTON_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
npm start

# frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## DevNet backend quick check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/tap/balance/<party-id>
```

If you need a full infrastructure deployment, use `operations/deployment` and `operations/devnet-deploy`.
