title: Swaps and liquidity
description: How users swap and provide liquidity in OneSwap pools.
---

## Swap flow

1. You choose input and output token.
2. OneSwap quotes output, fee, and price impact.
3. User sends input token to the pool swap address.
4. Backend executes the swap and returns output to the same wallet.

## Liquidity flow

1. User sends token A and token B to the pool LP address.
2. Deposits are paired by sender and session.
3. LP balance is credited.
4. Tokens move from LP party to swap party reserves.

If a matching pair is not completed in time, the system can refund.

## Supported assets

- `CC` (Canton Coin / Amulet)
- `USDCx`

## Pricing model

OneSwap uses constant product pricing:

`x * y = k`

Where `x` and `y` are pool reserves.

## Current operational assumptions

- LP accounting may be tracked in backend storage depending on deployment mode.
- USDCx flows can require TransferOffer acceptance steps.
