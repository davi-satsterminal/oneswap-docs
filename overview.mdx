# OneSwap

OneSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) on Canton Network. You use it to swap `CC` and `USDCx`, provide liquidity, and run automated pool operations on validator infrastructure.

## What you can do

- Swap tokens using AMM pricing
- Add and remove liquidity from pools
- Track pool balances and LP positions
- Run backend automations for deposit detection and execution

## Core model

- Formula: `x * y = k`
- Fee split: `80%` to LPs, `20%` to platform
- Pool architecture: one swap party and one LP party per pool

## Product flow

1. You create or select a pool.
2. Users deposit tokens into pool addresses.
3. OneSwap services detect deposits and execute swap or LP logic.
4. Outputs are settled on Canton.
